You are an expert in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Product Category Rules (PCR). 
    You are creating a process flow graph of the upstream, core and downstream processes of the product categories {}.
    The clusters of processes that should be included in the graph are : {}

    First, create process names for each of the clusters:
    1.  Provide a name for each cluster that describes the processes. Ensure that the name accurately reflects the processes that are listed in the cluster. 
    The cluster name should be as broad as possible, and should describe each of the processes in the cluster. Do not exclude processes in the description.

    The following steps will utilize the cluster names generated above.

    Based on the cluster names above, carefully follow the instructions below to create the directed process flow graph:
    1. Each cluster name should be applicable to any product within the product categories {}. If there is a cluster that refers to a more specific product, exclude it at note it in the "exlucded processes" section
    2. If relevant, there should be a cluster 
    2. Order each of the cluster names by the sequence in which they are done and create edges between each of these cluster names. 
    3. If one of the cluster names described above is a subprocess of another cluster name, indicate this by creating an edge from the subprocess to the cluster name (ex. subprocess --> cluster name). Indicate that it is a subprocess.

    Only include the processes in the list given. Do not include any other processes 

    4. Give a single JSON based on the information given above in the exact format given below:

    {{
    "exlcluded_processes": [<excluded_cluster_name_1, excluded_cluster_name_2 ...]
    "processes": {{
            <cluster_name> : {{
                "description": <cluster_name_description>,
                "process_category": <list either upstream, core or downstream>,
                "is_subprocess": <list either subprocess or process>,
                "input_nodes": [ input_node_1, input_node_2 ...
                ], 
                "output_nodes": [output_node_1, output_node_2 ...], 
                “reasoning:  < provide a detailed description of the rationale of the reason why the process is upstream, core or downstream>
    
            }},
                <cluster_name_2> : {{
                "description": <cluster_name_description>,
                "process_category": <list either upstream, core or downstream>,
                "is_subprocess": <list either subprocess or process>,
                "input_nodes": [ input_1, input_node_2 ...
                ], 
                "output_nodes": [output_node_1, output_node_2 ...], 
                “reasoning:  < provide a detailed description of the rationale of the reason why the process is upstream, core or downstream>
    
            }},
                    ...
        }}
    }}
    Important Instructions:
    1. Ensure that the JSON format given is followed exactly. Do not follow any other JSON format
    2. Ensure your response includes a clear and concise breakdown of each process, using the information provided in the input JSON. 
    3. Be sure that each process is as detailed as possible
    5. Provide details of all assumptions made and rationale behind each determination.
